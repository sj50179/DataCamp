Because the data are of different types, `data` is an object called a [structured array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html). Because numpy arrays have to contain elements that are all the same type, the structured array solves this by being a 1D array, where each element of the array is a row of the flat file imported.

    "The `pandas` package is also great at dealing with many of the issues you will encounter when importing data as a data scientist, such as comments occurring in flat files, empty lines and missing values. Note that missing values are also commonly referred to as `NA` or `NaN`. To wrap up this chapter, you're now going to import a slightly corrupted copy of the Titanic dataset `titanic_corrupt.txt`, which contains comments after the character `'#'` is tab-delimited."
