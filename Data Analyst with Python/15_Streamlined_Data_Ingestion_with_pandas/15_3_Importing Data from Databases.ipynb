    "# 3. Importing Data from Databases\n",
    "**Combine pandas with the powers of SQL to find out just how many problems New Yorkers have with their housing. This chapter features introductory SQL topics like WHERE clauses, aggregate functions, and basic joins.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to databases\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn to build pipelines to relational databases, which underpin the information systems of many organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational Databases\n",
    "Relational databases organize data about entities in tables, with rows representing instances of entities and columns of attributes. This probably sounds familiar -- data frames, flat files, and many Excel sheets arrange data similarly. Relational databases differ in that tables can be linked, or related, via unique record identifiers, or keys. Databases handle more data and support more simultaneous users than spreadsheets or flat files. They also offer more data quality controls, like enforcing column data types. And we interface with databases via a specific language: Structured Query Language, or SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Relational Databases\n",
    "Common relational databases include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, which this course uses. Unlike the others, SQLite databases are stored as regular, self-contained computer files, just as CSVs and Excel files are, making them great for sharing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to Databases\n",
    "Reading data from a database is a two-step process. We first make a way to connect to a database then query it with SQL and pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Database Engine\n",
    "To do this, we'll use the `SQLAlchemy` library, which has tools to work with many major relational databases. Specifically, we'll use `SQLAlchemy`'s `create_engine()` function. Create engine takes a string URL to a database and makes an engine object that manages database connections. URLs follow a pattern that varies slightly depending on the database. For SQLite, the pattern is `sqlite:///filename.db`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Querying Databases\n",
    "Once we create the database engine, we can pull data with pandas' read SQL function. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "pd.read_sql(query, engine)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Read SQL needs two arguments. The first is a string of either a SQL query, or, to load a whole table, just the table name. The second argument is a way to connect to the database. We'll supply the engine we made here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Review: SELECT\n",
    "Let's take a minute to review SQL select statements, which are used to query databases. The basic syntax is `SELECT column_names FROM table_name`. This will get all rows for the specified columns. To get all rows and all columns, use `SELECT * FROM tabel_name` A note about code style: keywords like \"select\" and \"from\" are not case sensitive, but it's conventional to type them in **all capital letters**. It's also best practice to mark the end of a SQL statement with a semicolon(;).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Data from a Database\n",
    "Now let's put all this together to fetch weather data from a SQLite database containing information about New York City. We import pandas as pd, plus the create engine function from SQLAlchemy. Then we make the engine object, passing the database URL string, sqlite colon slash slash slash data dot db, to the create engine function. "

    "## Refining imports with SQL queries\n",
    "Now that you know how to connect to a database and query it with pandas, let's focus on refining imports with different SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SELECTing Columns\n",
    "pandas' read SQL function has fewer arguments than read Excel or read CSV, but SQL lets you customize data imports in even more ways. The last lesson mentioned one such way. Specifying columns in a select statement lets you load only variables you are interested in studying, akin to usecols in read Excel and read CSV. \n",

    "```\n",
    "for example, gets only the date and average temperatures in the weather table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHERE Clauses\n",
    "The other common way to selectively get data with SQL is by using a where clause to filter rows. The syntax looks like \"select columns from table where\" a given condition or conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering by Numbers\n",
    "To import records based on numeric values, we can use standard operators to compare numbers: equals, greater than and greater than or equal to, less than and less than or equal to, and not equal to. Note that SQL's equality and inequality operators differ from Python's. The weather data contains Fahrenheit temperatures, so the SQL query to get all days with a high temperature above freezing would be \"select star from weather where t max is greater than 32.\"\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM weather\n",
    "WHERE tmax > 32;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering Text\n",
    "Where clauses can also filter text. To match a string exactly, use the equal sign followed by the text to match in single quotes. Note that string matching is case sensitive. To get call records about incidents in the borough of Brooklyn, for example, the query would be \"select star from hpd311calls where borough equals Brooklyn\", with Brooklyn in single quotes.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "/* Get records about incidents in Brooklyn */\n",

    "FROM hpd311calls\n",
    "WHERE borough = 'BROOKYN';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL and pandas\n",
    "Let's combine SQL and Python to get Brooklyn calls. As before, we import pandas and SQLalchemy's create engine function. We pass create engine the URL to data dot db and assign the result to engine. Since our SQL queries are getting more complicated, we'll write out the query first and assign it to the variable \"query.\" Wrapping the string in triple quotes lets us split it between multiple lines so it's easier to read. Then we pass the query and engine to read SQL. When we check the unique borough values in the resulting data frame, we see there are only Brooklyn calls."

    "Datasets can contain columns that are not required for an analysis, like the `weather` table in `data.db` does. Some, such as elevation, are redundant, since all observations occurred at the same place, while others contain variables we are not interested in. After making a database engine, you'll write a query to `SELECT `only the date and temperature columns, and pass both to `read_sql()` to make a data frame of high and low temperature readings.\n",

    "## More complex SQL queries\n",
    "The SQL we've used so far mimics the functionality of `pandas` keyword arguments like `usecols` and `skiprows`. In this lesson, we'll take advantage of SQL's features to wrangle data in ways that cannot be done at the import stage using pandas alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting DISTINCT Values\n",
    "In an analysis, you might need unique values in a column, or unique combinations of values across several columns. Examples include getting unique values to check data quality and creating crosswalks between values to combine datasets. Alternatively, data might have duplicate records that should be excluded. Pandas has tools to do this wrangling in data frames, but it can be done with SQL during import using select distinct. The syntax is \"select distinct column names from table\". To remove duplicate records, select distinct on all columns with the query \"select distinct star from table\". For another example, if we wanted to map buildings with housing complaints, we could use the query \"select distinct incident address, borough from hpd311calls\" to get unique street addresses and boroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "/* Get unique street addresses and boroughs */\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT incident_address, borough\n",
    "  FROM hpd311calls;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregate Functions\n",
    "Other times, you might not be interested in the details of individual records, particularly when visualizing data. You can query the database directly for descriptive statistics with aggregate functions like sum, average, max, min, and count.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first four functions all take a single column name in parentheses. For example, the query \"select average t max from weather\", with tmax in parentheses, returns the average daily high temperature. Count is a little different. While it can accept a single column name, you can do things like get the number of rows that fit a query with count star, or even get the number of unique values in a column with count distinct and the column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GROUP BY\n",
    "Aggregate functions return a single number on their own. More likely, you want data summarized by categories, such as average high temperatures by month or counts of plumbing complaints by borough. In that case, add a group by clause after the select statement and where clauses. Remember to select the column you're grouping by as well as the aggregate function -- otherwise you'll end up with unlabeled summary figures for each group. The query to get counts of plumbing complaints by borough, for example, would be \"select borough, count star from hpd311calls where complaint type equals plumbing, group by borough\"\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "/* Get counts of plumbing calls by borough */\n",
    "SELECT borough,\n",
    "       COUNT(*)\n",
    "  FROM hpd311calls\n",
    " WHERE complaint_type = 'PLUMBING'\n",
    " GROUP BY borough;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting by Groups\n",
    "Let's see what the results of that query look like in a data frame. With the necessary libraries imported, we create the engine, write out the query, then pass the query and engine to pandas' read SQL function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we check the results, we see we have a neat summary data frame ready for plotting."

    "## Loading multiple tables with joins\n",
    "One feature of relational databases is that tables can be linked to one another via unique record identifiers, or keys. This lets users combine tables into custom datasets with SQL joins, which we'll explore in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keys\n",
    "As mentioned, records typically have keys that uniquely identify them. At their simplest, keys can be automatically assigned row numbers, like in the 311 call data, but they can also carry meaning, like university course numbers. When records include other tables' keys, you can bring in, or join, data from the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given a column of instructor ID numbers and a professor table, we can then join in professors' names. When building data pipelines, this means you're not limited to working with a single table's columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joining Tables\n",
    "Let's join weather data to 311 call records to study if certain problems are exacerbated by weather conditions. Both tables contain date columns as text, with unique dates in the weather table, so they'll be the join key.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we select star from hpd311calls to get all columns there. Star will also get all columns from weather once we join it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we join weather on hpd311calls dot created date equals weather dot date, which are the key columns. We use dot notation to specify the table and column when querying multiple tables. Two things to note here: join, by default, only returns records with key values that appear in both tables. And key columns must be the same data type or nothing will match.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "  FROM hpd311calls\n",
    "  JOIN weather\n",
    "    ON hpd311calls.created_date = weather.date;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joining and Filtering\n",
    "We can incorporate a where clause after the join to refine the dataset. Here, we filter the data to focus on heat and hot water calls, which probably spike in cold weather.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "/* Get only heat/hot water calls and join in weather data */\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    " FROM hpd311calls\n",
    " JOIN weather\n",
    "   ON hpd311calls.created_date = weather.date\n",
    "WHERE hpd311calls.complaint_type = 'HEAT/HOT WATER';\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's even possible to summarize data and then join additional columns. Imagine we wanted to compare call counts by borough against census data about population and housing in another table, boro census. Let's build the query in parts. We first get call counts by borough by selecting `hpd311calls.borough` and count star from hpd311calls, grouping by hpd311calls dot borough. Because both tables have borough columns, we have to specify the table here.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "/* Get call counts by borough */\n",
    "SELECT hpd311calls.borough,\n",
    "\t   COUNT(*)\n",
    "  FROM hpd311calls\n",
    " GROUP BY hpd311calls.borough;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joining and Aggregating\n",
    "The boro census table has more columns than we need, so we also select its total population and housing units columns. Notice that we don't have to list boro census in the from clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we add the join clause between the from and group by clauses, joining on the borough columns.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "/* Get call counts by borough\n",
    "   and join in population and housing counts */\n",
    "SELECT hpd311calls.borough,\n",
    "       COUNT(*),\n",
    "\t   boro_census.total_population,\n",
    "\t   boro_census.housing_units\n",
    " FROM hpd311calls\n",
    "      JOIN boro_census\n",
    "\t  ON hpd311calls.borough = boro_census.borough\n",
    "GROUP BY hpd311calls.borough;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's pass this query and the database engine to read SQL and check out the results. Looks like the Bronx is overrepresented in our call data.\n"
